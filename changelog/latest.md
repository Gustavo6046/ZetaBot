# ZetaBot v0.11.0

Another big update that took a while to come out! This time,
this one packs a larger number of features.

 * Added the ability to _see_ the entire path network (`zt_showpaths`)
 * Added an experimental version of _orders_
 * Added many additional _node types_
 * Greatly optimized the path finding code
 * Cleaner logs and less frivolous printing to the console
 * Fixed many very serious bugs
 * Changed ACS code to use named scripts to avoid conflicts
 * Initial stub of the [Doom II pathnoding project](../nodes/Doom2_MAP01.txt) (currently only MAP01 is supported)
 * Automatic releases and an actual changelog file!
 * And more!
