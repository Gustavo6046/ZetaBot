# ZetaBot v0.11.0

Another big update that took a while to come out! This time,
this one packs a larger number of features.

## General
 * Initial stub of the [Doom II pathnoding project](../nodes/Doom2_MAP01.txt) (currently only MAP01 is supported)
 * Cleaner logs, with reduced printing to the console
 * Changed ACS code to use named scripts to avoid conflicts
 * Automatic releases and an actual changelog file

## Pathing
 * Added many additional _node types_; see the controls menu for details!
 * Greatly optimized the path finding code

## AI
 * Added an experimental version of _orders_

## Bugfixes
 * Fixed some rare fatal errors when a bot respawns after the corpse is despawned fully

And more! ~~(that I probably just can't recall off the top of my head)~~
